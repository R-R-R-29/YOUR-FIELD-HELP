Project Description
This project is a web-based tool designed to assist farmers, agricultural experts, and enthusiasts in optimizing crop production by providing essential insights for better agricultural yield and planning.

The Problem Statement
Farmers often struggle with predicting the best growing conditions, optimal sowing dates, and crop yield due to lack of data-driven insights.

The Solution
Our tool uses crop details and field images to predict optimal yield dates, seed requirements, and growing conditions for both North and South India. By analyzing these inputs, we offer actionable recommendations to improve crop production.

Project Demo

[Add your demo video link here] 
With html and css we created a front end page , which allows the user to input an image of their field,select the type of crop using a drop down menu,and also input the sowing date. The website will show the optimal area(distance between two crops),optimal season for harvesting and dates between which it could be harvested.We have used SQL to store the required data and backed is done  using fastAPI
